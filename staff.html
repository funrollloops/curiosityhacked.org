            </header>
            <p>Shoshana started making things as a child in her father&#39;s
            workshop and just never stopped. She attended a technical
            arts high school in San Francisco (<a href="http://lwhs.org/"
            target="_blank">lwhs.org</a>) and has taken arts courses all
            over the Bay Area. Over the years she&#39;s built
            furniture, jewelry, welded sculpture, glass, handmade books,
            clothing, arduino-based toys, wooden boxes, and large-scale
            compute systems. Between art projects she acquired a
            college degree in English and a career in computer
            engineering. For Curiosity Hacked, Shoshana likes to plan
            projects that blend handmade crafts with science or electronics,
            ideally allowing kids to design and build something they can use
            in everyday life. Shoshana has an 11-year-old son who
            likes math, science, and video games.</p>

            introduced to a new and exciting approach to his craft, one that
            would define the path of his graduate studies. His newfound
            passion would lay the foundation for his establishment of the

            and technology in the community of Las Vegas.<a

            built on previous research at the Harvard Graduate School of
