          <span class="byline">Our weekly skill building program</span>
        </header>

<p>The core value of Curiosity Hacked is:&nbsp;<strong>The unrelenting pursuit of knowledge.</strong> The core value
contains two parts:&nbsp;<strong>persistence</strong>, which is needed to follow the hacker path,
and&nbsp;<strong>understanding</strong>. Understanding is broken into three sections:</p>
<ul class='style4'>
<li><strong>Understanding Yourself</strong>
<ul class='style4'>
<li>resourcefulness -&nbsp;<em>understanding your potential</em></li>
<li>creativity -&nbsp;<em>understanding your mind</em></li>
<li>positive attitude -&nbsp;<em>understanding your emotion</em></li>
<li>health -&nbsp;<em>understanding your body</em></li>
<li>initiative -&nbsp;<em>understanding your opportunity</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Understanding Others</strong>
<ul class='style4'>
<li>compassion -&nbsp;<em>understanding their emotions</em></li>
<li>cooperation -&nbsp;<em>understanding their potential</em></li>
<li>honesty -&nbsp;<em>understanding communication</em></li>
<li>respect -&nbsp;<em>understanding their value</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Understanding the World</strong>
<ul class='style4'>
<li>responsibility -&nbsp;<em>understanding your role</em></li>
<li>open mind/tolerant -&nbsp;<em>understanding perspective</em></li>
<li>critical mind/inquisitive -&nbsp;<em>understanding understanding</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<h3>Why Curiosity Hacked?</h3>
<ul class='style4'>
<li>Because our world will benefit from a more educated population</li>
<li>Because our technology is changing rapidly</li>
<li>Few school programs and youth organizations include technological education</li>
<li>Many people don&#39;t understand the technology they use every day&nbsp;current options are limited</li>
<li>There is no youth organization that is all-inclusive and focuses on the open-minded search for knowledge,</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Hacking?</h3>
<ul class='style4'>
<li>Hands-on Learning is the best way to get interested and retain information in complex areas</li>
<li>Learning physical skills empowers people to affect the world around them</li>
</ul>
<h3>What will enrolled children do?</h3>

<span class='byline'>Learn new concepts and skills</span>
<ul class='style3'>
<li>Curiosity Hacked is focused primarily on learning. The world is an amazing place, with so many possibilities. Knowledge is the key to unlocking these opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<span class='byline'>Make things</span>
<ul class='style3'>
<li>The best way to learn is by doing, and by making things young hackers can use their knowledge to make the world a better
and more exciting place. Making is an empowering experience that will help our children achieve their goals.</li>
</ul>

<span class='byline'>Make Friends</span>
<ul class='style3'>
<li>Curitosity Hacked provides youth with the opportunity to meet and interact with children outside their own class, school or community.</li>
</ul>

<span class='byline'>Earn badges</span>
<ul class='style3'>
<li>Badges signify achievements in learning and making. After a child shows that she/he can demonstrate a specific set
of skills, that child can earn a badge, which can be worn on their tool belt.</li>
</ul>

<span class='byline'>Trips</span>
<ul class='style3'>
<li>Guild plans outings to museums, science centers, factories, engineering facilities and universities. These outings
help young hackers learn new concepts with hands on exercises, or inspire children by seeing what engineers and scientists in the
field are doing.</li>
</ul>

<span class='byline'>Service Projects</span>
<ul class='style3'>
<li>Guild plans service projects to give back to their local community.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><p></p>

<span class='byline strong'>Curiosity Hacked is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all persons and does not discriminate on the
basis of race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, or
religion in our educational programs and activities.</span>
