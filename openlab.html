        />Open Lab is an all ages program based on how children learn through
        various developmental and educational theories as well as a desire we
        see in the Maker culture for community and family inclusiveness.  The
        idea is this: Twice a month we hold Open Labs where we have
        experts/mentors available to help kids with any project they bring in.
        There is also a featured project that a whole workshop is built around
        that specifically targets skill building. In addition, there is always a
        menu of other kits/activities that are available for kids that focus on
        a variety of interests, skills, and ways of learning. The structure has
        a method- it creates consistency and the opportunity for mentoring and
        improvement, the provided activities and featured workshops are designed
        to teach to multiple learning styles, the format supports autonomy and
        independence, and the program is inclusive and adaptable. Kids can earn
        badges or not for their skill building, and they can come every week or
        once in a while. The result is exceptional and exciting- families have
        come and learned, shared, hacked and formed community in our hackerspace
        while thriving on the opportunity to learn new skills, reinforce
        knowledge, and benefit from mentoring to explore their own interests and
        achieve their unique goals. </p></span>
