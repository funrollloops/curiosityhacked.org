        Curiosity Hacked is currently designing a weekly program for younger children (4-8) who are ready and interested
        in basic skill building and concepts. Curiosity Hacked Sparks will approach the same high level of education, skill
        building, and self-determination in an appropriate way for the younger kids. Our idea is to have independent modules
        which will explore in an interdisciplinary manner the same concepts and skills approached on our badge tree. Same
        dedication to child development, high expectations, high levels of mentoring and experience. We plan on having the first
        stage of this program up soon. Until then, any younger programs wanting to start now can choose from a great
        variety of projects we have done for Open Lab to work on weekly. Please email us for more information!</p></span>
