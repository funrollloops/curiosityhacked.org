         <h3>Organizational Structure</h3>
         <ul class='style4'> <li>The main group is called a&nbsp;<strong>Guild</strong></li>
           <li>The subgroups are called&nbsp;<strong>crews</strong> 
             <ul class='style4'> <li>Each crew can contain between 5 and 10 young hackers</li>
               <li>each crew should be working toward a similar project</li> 
               <li>Children can switch between crews, but switching often is not recommended, as it can be disruptive for the learning
         process.</li>

         <h3>Meetings</h3>
         <p>Every
         Guild begins with the Hackerling Circuit project, which is an Arduino
         Shield (circuit board) that gives all of our young hackers a well rounded
         education in STEAM concepts and exposing them to the fundamentals of
         skills, resources, and ideas. Not only does this project give our kids a
         strong foundation to work from, but it also allows them the the
         opportunity to make autonomous decisions around their own interests and
         what badges they may want to pursue later on. &nbsp;Every meeting also
         includes a short activity that provokes thought and discussion on one of
         our core values. </p>

         <h3>Hackerling Circuit</h3>

         <p>When young hackers
         start on their journey, it is important to learn the basics of what it
         means to be a hacker, and how to handle the basic tools of the
         trade. Young hackers enter at the &ldquo;hackerling&rdquo;
         stage and they must master a few basic skills to become full hackers.
         These skills include:
         <ul class='style4'> 
           <li>Soldering</li> 
           <li>Electrical component identification</li> 
           <li>Basic sewing</li> 
           <li>Basic woodworking</li>
           <li>Simple Linux use</li>
           <li>Achieving their first badge</li> 
         </ul>
         <p>By mastering all these areas, hackerlings will have the foundation
         necessary to work in a hacker crew, on exciting projects! Once the group
         has successfully completed their Hackerling Circuit, they move into
         smaller groups of Crews to work on badge projects. The group as a whole,
         also has the opportunity to work on larger projects and attend field
         trips together. Crew&nbsp;projects: To begin, we will pick 3 projects
         with different difficulties and skill sets and divide into crews based
         on who wants to do what project. Each meeting will have lessons about
         the underlying science behind the projects. Crews will find additional
         resources to further the Guild&#39;s knowledge.</p>
         <h3>Documentation</h3>
         <ul class='style4'> 
           <li>An important part of any
         maker&#39;s journey is documentation.</li> 
           <li>A wiki/other journaling
         site will be available for documenting each child's project,
         including:</li> 
           <li>detailing how it works,</li> 
           <li>linking to useful
         resources.</li> 
           <li>Each crew will create a page detailing their
         project, so others can do the same.</li> 
         </ul>
         <p></p>
         <h2>Teens</h2> <p> The Guild
         program is primarily designed for kids ages 8-15, but every Guild has
         the option of including a Teen program. Our teens are usually skilled
         and motivated, needing a balance of autonomy and guidance. In the Guild,
         teens are required to do the following:</p> 
         <div class='row'>
         <div class='6u'>
         <span class='image image-left'><img src='images/teens.jpg' alt='' /></span>
         </div>
         <div class='6u'>
         <ul class='style4'> 
           <li>Design and work on
         their own projects. The length and scope will be their choice, and the
         mentors will be available to help guide them through their process.
         Leaders will also facilitate mentorships for teens outside of Guild
         volunteers with skilled experts in the community for specialized
         learning.</li> 
           <li>Teens must test for badges at the adult level.</li>
           <li>Teens should document their work.</li>
           <li>Teens will be regularly
         asked to help mentor the younger kids in Guild. They will also have the
         opportunity to design and teach activities at Open Lab (if
         applicable).</li> 
         </ul>
         </div>
         </div>
         <p>Teens make a wonderful and dynamic addition
         to the Guild. The younger kids see them as role models, and the teens
         benefit from a reinforcement of their knowledge with an opportunity to
         learn new skills and attempt projects that will stretch their
         abilities.</p> <p>We are also actively working on a way for all teens to
         have &nbsp;certification along with any badges they are awarded that
         they could use on resumes and college applications. We believe that the
         skills and knowledge they gain have a direct impact on their abilities
         as students, interns, and employees. More details coming
         soon!</p></p></span>
